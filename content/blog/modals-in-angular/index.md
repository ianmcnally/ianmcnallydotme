If you find yourself needing a modal library in your Angular app, check out btford’s [angular-modal](https://github.com/btford/angular-modal). It’s got a great API and has a lot of flexibility.

All you need is a bit of styling around your modal, inject the modal as a factory where you want to control it, and bam. You’re done.
