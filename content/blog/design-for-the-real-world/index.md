I’m really excited to receive my copy of [Design of the Real World](http://www.thamesandhudson.com/Design_for_the_Real_World/9780500273586) by Victor Papanek.

The presentation centered around being a responsible and considerate human being, and spending your efforts on doing good for the world. Luke W. had a good [write-up](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1861) on it.
