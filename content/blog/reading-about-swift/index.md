The more I [read](http://www.appcoda.com/swift-programming-language-intro/) about Swift, Appleâ€™s new programming language, the more excited I get about it. It takes some heavy cues from Javascript, Ruby and Python (my top three languages), which for me means less conceptual overhead. It suddenly feels much less daunting to learn native iOS development compared to Objective-C and its _unique_ ways of doing things.

It might be time to port [In My Fridge](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/in-my-fridge/id735487498) to native from a hybrid app.
