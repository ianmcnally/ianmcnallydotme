title: "TIL Firefox hates :placeholder line-height"

My input placeholder looked great in Chrome, but too high up on Firefox. After some [reading](http://www.cssnewbie.com/input-button-line-height-bug/#.VAnOn0hPYfk), I chalked it up to FF interpreting line-height differently, so I added a little padding, and it centered in both.

Itâ€™s not right!
