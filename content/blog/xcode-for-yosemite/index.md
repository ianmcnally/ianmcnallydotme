A little tip from homebrew to me, to you:

Xcode 6.1 is required on Yosemite to compile anything (6.0.1 does not include the 10.10 SDK). Apple have not yet uploaded it to the App Store. Instead it must be downloaded from: [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer\_Tools/xcode\_6.1/xcode\_6.1.dmg](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer_Tools/xcode_6.1/xcode_6.1.dmg)
