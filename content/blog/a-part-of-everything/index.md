I’ve spent the last year or two specializing in front end development. Apart from being the most rewarding and creative outlet for programming I’ve found, I think it takes an expert in javascript and CSS to built the sort of interactive, human applications that people enjoy using. We like nice things!

Think about how banking is much cooler with Simple, or how nice it is to read on Medium. They both have awesome web products. They stand out in crowded markets because they care about their product and their users. The user perspective, the product design, and the user experience that you tune into as a front end developer are the same considerations that permeate all levels of a great product, be it the conception, design, the marketing, and so on.
