I’ve been diving into accessibility, and finally found a list of `role` attributes.

It can save you from some [pickles](http://ia-n.com/post/116486199032/why-are-not-all-flexbox-elements-behaving-like).

Also, don’t forget the there are ARIA [implied roles](http://html5doctor.com/on-html-belts-and-aria-braces/) for semantic elements.
