I'm Â happy to announce I just released the first version of my autocomplete widget for React, called react-input-completion. It's live on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-input-completion) and [github](https://github.com/imcnally/react-input-completion).

Feedback and input (pun intended) are more than welcome!
