My humble beginnings with React, featuring something like redacted text.

Generally, I find React odd. You have to directly inject HTML into your javascript, then have a parser for it. Also, you canâ€™t use conventional markup, like `class=""`, you have to use React-specific `className`. Also, React is really heavy on jargon.
