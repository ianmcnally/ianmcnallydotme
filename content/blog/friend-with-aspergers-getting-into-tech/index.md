About five years ago, I made the switch from music to software. I was fortunate enough to land a great opportunity, which allowed me to learn on the job and work my way up. I couldn’t have done it without great mentors. I also had the privilege of a good education, a job, and social skills.

I’ve been mentoring a friend with aspergers, who just graduated college and wants to get into tech. He’s finally found his calling in software, but he’s having a tough time starting out. His application to a bootcamp was rejected for not being “creative enough”. 

Anyone have advice for my friend?
