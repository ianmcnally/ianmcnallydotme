![ A Bill Murray carousel with Slick ](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/554569a4e4b0b68214c1f5d9/55457b34e4b0fca745eb358d/556cb345e4b0803e0ffb02da/1433187161232//img.gif)

Came across a fantastic carousel library called [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). It's extremely flexible, comes with some helper CSS, and adapts to the markup on the page.

It makes Bill Murray sliders really easy, too!
