Today I gave a [talk](http://livestream.com/intentmedia/events/4425205) (embed below) at Intent Media, titled _65 Things You Can Do Right Now To Build Better Websites_ (at 33:44)_. _I talk about common practices in javascript, HTML and CSS. I also had fun making the title clickbait-y.

My colleague Lisa kicks it off with a great talk on micro services.
