title: "<a> in Angular"

Today, I was working on making a Rails & Angular project HTML 5 URL compatible. I arrived at a snag, where my anchor tags werenâ€™t causing a page change when I wanted them to.

The fix was to make sure the `<a>` tags had `target = '_self'`, so Angular would stop absorbing the clicks.
