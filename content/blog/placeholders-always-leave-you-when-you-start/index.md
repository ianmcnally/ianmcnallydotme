![ Morphing placeholder and input label ](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/554569a4e4b0b68214c1f5d9/55457b34e4b0fca745eb358d/55457b34e4b0fca745eb35b6/1430616943213//img.gif)

Placeholders always leave you (when you start typing). Labels just don’t do enough on their own.

Combine the two, and things get awesome. A placeholder that morphs into a label.
