[JSCS](http://jscs.info) is an awesome new style checker for Javascript. Plugins are available for all the major editors, IDEs and build tools (my faves: [Sublime Text JSCS formatter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JSCS-Formatter), [Grunt JSCS](https://github.com/jscs-dev/grunt-jscs)). The one hard thing? Getting a good default configuration file.

I spent some time creating my .jscsrc, so I hope it might save you some time too.
