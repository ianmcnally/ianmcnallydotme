I’ve been using [SCSS Lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) recently, and I like it. Except when I break the build, but that’s another story.

On projects, I’ve been moving over to using REMs almost exclusively. Today, I stepped up my fight to remove pixels from my SASS, which a pull request to scss-lint.
