I've been having some fun today planning out a carousel in React.

One feature request was that any slide could be the next slide, and the user shouldn't see the "in between" slides.

I'll have more on the technique, at some point. Getting the 3D perspective and flipping was difficult, but I had some [help](https://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/examples/carousel-02-dynamic.html).

Demo below, or check it out on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/imcnally/pen/gpQdpe).
