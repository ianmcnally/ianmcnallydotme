I was about to start a new side project, when I realized the crazy amount of setup I'd have to do to get up and running. I wanted to use my favorite latest things, but I had nowhere to start. So I started grabbing from prior projects and some open source libs, to create my latest starter framework. I'm optimistically calling it my 2016 web boilerplate.

It includes, in no specific order:

- Webpack
- JSCS
- ESLint
- Karma
- Mocha, Chai, Sinon
- PhantomJS 2
- React
- PostCSS
- ES2015+ via Babel
- Hot module reloading

Now get our there, and start building cool things! Happy new year!
